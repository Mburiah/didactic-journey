### This is a Portfolio Landing Page that I created using, HTML and CSS. 
The portfolio is an easier way of knowing more about me in a more attractive manner than a CV because it contains visuals like images and animations.
You can also get to know the following about me:
>Hobbies
>Likes
>Skills

And also,you can have a glimpse of my previous works and projects. Hope you'll find it interesting.

### You can view my portfolio website via this link (https://mburiah.github.io/didactic-journey/)
